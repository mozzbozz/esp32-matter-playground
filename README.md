# ESP32-C6: Matter over Thread

This guide shows how to build the simple `light` example from the esp-matter SDK for the ESP32-C6 to use Matter over Thread - because if you just build that example according to the official instructions, it will use Matter over WiFi instead. If you build the example for the ESP32-H2 (which only has Thread and BLE, but no WiFi - unlike the ESP32-C6), it will likely "just work" out of the box.
